CPU and memory footprint are low during that time._\n\nDeployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.\n\nThis is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.\n\nThis vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was resolved in Next.js 14.2.21, 15.1.2, and 13.5.8. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to the PackDraw team for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.",

When images returned from API routes vary based on request headers (such as `Cookie` or `Authorization`), these responses could be incorrectly cached and served to unauthorized users due to a cache key confusion bug.\n\nAll users are encouraged to upgrade if they use API routes to serve images that depend on request headers and have image optimization enabled.\n\nMore details at [Vercel Changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-57752)",
